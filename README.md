# Ops Intelligence Hub

> **Internal operating system for the AI & Automation Lead at ARIE Finance.**
> This is NOT a public SaaS product. It is a focused internal tool designed to help the AI & Automation Lead integrate into the company quickly, identify operational bottlenecks, capture employee suggestions, prioritise automation opportunities, track execution, and prove impact.

---

## What This Is

Ops Intelligence Hub is the central control panel for:

- **Employee suggestions** — anyone in the company can report a problem, suggest an improvement, or share a quick idea
- **Operational pain points** — structured capture of what's slow, manual, or error-prone
- **Automation prioritisation** — scoring system that surfaces the biggest bottlenecks and easiest quick wins
- **Execution tracking** — pipeline view of what's being built and deployed
- **Impact measurement** — hours wasted vs hours saved, before/after comparisons
- **"You Said / We Fixed" feed** — visible proof that employee input leads to real change

The goal: **look effective early, move fast, show results.**

---

## Who It's For

| Role | How they use it |
|------|----------------|
| **AI & Automation Lead** | Reviews submissions, scores automation potential, tracks execution, reports to management |
| **All employees** | Submit problems, suggestions, or quick ideas via the `/submit` form |
| **Management** | Views dashboard for bottleneck/impact reporting, sees the public feed |

---

## Product Modules

### 1. Submissions (`/submit`)
Employee-facing form branded as **"Improve Our Work"**. Supports three types:
- **Problem** — full structured form with process name, system, time metrics, frustration level, risk flags
- **Suggestion** — structured improvement proposal
- **Quick Idea** — lightweight, just department + description

Key fields: `submission_type`, `process_name`, `system_used`, `time_per_occurrence`, `occurrences_per_week`, `frustration_level` (1–5), `error_risk`, `affects_client`, `involves_money`

### 2. Review Engine (`/admin/[id]`)
Admin review and scoring interface:
- `automation_potential` (1–5 button grid)
- `implementation_effort` (Quick / Medium / Heavy)
- `review_category` (Automation / Process / Training / Ignore)
- `impact_level`, `estimated_hours_saved_monthly`
- Computed **priority score** displayed in real-time
- Status progression: New → Reviewing → Accepted → In Progress → Implemented

### 3. Execution Pipeline (`/admin/pipeline`)
Delivery tracking module:
- `solution_type`, `tool_used`, `status` (Planned → Deployed)
- `before_time`, `after_time`, `actual_hours_saved`
- `deployed_link`, `notes`

### 4. Dashboard (`/admin/dashboard`)
Internal analytics:
- Total submissions, hours wasted/month, hours saved, deployments
- Status breakdown, department breakdown
- **Top bottlenecks** (highest hours wasted, excluding completed)
- **Quick wins** (high automation potential + quick effort)

### 5. Public Feed (`/updates`)
"You Said → We Fixed" with:
- Hours saved badges
- Before vs after summaries
- Monthly grouping

---

## Workflow Loop

```
Employee submits → Admin reviews & scores → Priority list generated →
Build/deploy tracked in pipeline → Published to "You Said / We Fixed" →
Employees see impact → More submissions → Cycle continues
```

---

## Prioritisation Logic

### Hours Wasted per Month
```
hours_wasted_month = (time_per_occurrence × occurrences_per_week × 4) / 60
```

### Priority Score
```
priority_score = hours_wasted_month × automation_potential × frustration_level
```

This surfaces items that are **frequent, painful, and automatable**.

## Data Model

Full schema: [`schema/001_initial.sql`](./schema/001_initial.sql)

| Table | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `submissions` | Employee submissions with structured fields |
| `review_actions` | Admin review scoring (1:1 with submissions) |
| `feed_items` | Published "You Said / We Fixed" entries |
| `execution_pipeline` | Delivery tracking items |

| View | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `admin_board` | Joins submissions + review_actions, computes `hours_wasted_month` and `priority_score` |
| `public_feed` | Read-only feed view |

---

| `POST` | `/api/submissions` | Create submission (rate-limited) |
| `POST` | `/api/auth/admin-login` | Authenticate admin — sets session cookie |
| `GET/POST` | `/api/auth/admin-logout` | Clear session cookie (GET redirects to login) |
| `GET` | `/api/admin/submissions/[id]` | Fetch admin board row |

## Security

### Current Protection (Temporary — Internal Tool)

| Feature | Implementation |
|---------|---------------|
| **Admin login gate** | `/admin/login` — password form that authenticates against `ADMIN_API_SECRET` |
| **Page-level protection** | Next.js middleware redirects all `/admin/*` page visits to login if not authenticated |
| **API-level protection** | Same middleware rejects all `/api/admin/*` calls with 401 if not authenticated |
| **Defence-in-depth** | Individual API routes also call `validateAdminRequest()` as a secondary check |
| **Session cookie** | `ops-admin-token` — HttpOnly, SameSite=Lax, Secure in production, 7-day expiry |
| **No unsafe fallback** | `supabaseAdmin` throws if `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` is missing — never silently falls back to anon key |
| **Rate limiting** | 10 submissions per 15 minutes per IP on the public endpoint |
| **Input validation** | All API routes validate types, ranges, and required fields |
| **Lazy client init** | Both Supabase clients use `Proxy` to avoid build-time crashes |
| **RLS enabled** | Row-level security on all tables in the schema |

### What This Is NOT

This is **not** a production-grade auth system. Specifically:

- There is **no user management** — a single shared password (`ADMIN_API_SECRET`) grants admin access
- The session cookie stores a token derived from the secret — it is HttpOnly (not accessible to JS) but not cryptographically signed
- There is **no role-based access control** — you are either an admin or you are not
- **Development mode** with no `ADMIN_API_SECRET` set bypasses all protection with a console warning

### Recommended Future Auth

For production hardening, replace the password gate with one of:
- **Supabase Auth** — email/magic link login with RLS policies
- **NextAuth.js** — OAuth provider (Google, GitHub) scoped to company domain
- **Vercel Password Protection** — zero-code page-level auth (Vercel Pro feature)
